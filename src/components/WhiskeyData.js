    age: 6,
    detail: `Thick, mature aromas, with notes of subtle spice, meadow grass, light molasses and leather. Pleasantly sweet at first in flavor, with notes of brown sugar and cinnamon, becoming dry with enveloping flavors of oak and leather. Finish long and dry.`

    isBourbon: true,
    isRye: false,
    age: null,
    detail: `Complex nose, with an appealing overlay of camphor. Sweetness comes first, a concentrated quality, then corn and wood smoke flavors with rye underpinning.. The finish is lingering with wood notes mingling with sweet maple syrup flavors.`

    name: "Old Forester",
    proof: 100,
    isBourbon: false,
    isRye: true,
    age: null,
    detail: `This old-timer opens with a rich, deep nose, layered with fresh cornmeal and cocoa. It's a full-bore Bourbon, packing bountiful sweet cornbread, cinnamon and dark chocolate, sliced by mint and fresh leather, and carried away on corn and vanilla. Powerful but refined.`

    proof: 118.4,
    isBourbon: false,
    isRye: true,
    age: 24,
    detail: `A great whiskey from beginning to end. Soothing layers of sweetness are balanced by candied fruit and waves of spice. The palate is clean, the flavors are deep, the spices are well-defined, and there's not one hint of excessive tired oak.`
